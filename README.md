A CLI for generating CRON expressions from natural english phrases in Go. 
</p>


It works by making a GET request to [cron prompt](https://cronprompt.com/).

ðŸš§WarningðŸš§
</h5>

Cron Prompt uses a Large Language Model to generate its Cron expressions. The resulting cron expressions may be innacurate or incomplete as a result. 
It may, however, be capable of handling more complex expressions than more deterministic libraries which use Pushdown automata. If a result seems slightly off, try to prompt the model with different wording.

Validate expressions with a tool like [Crontab](https://crontab.guru/) before use in any application.

0 20 31 10 *
cwon At 8pm during October 31st
0 20 31 10 *
cwon When McDonalds opens every day
0 6 * * *
cwon 30 minutes before 5am
30 4 * * *
cwon 30 minutes before 5th Fibbonaci Number am

```

### Example of a malformed result

```
cwon At every minute on October 31st
* 31 10 * *
```

this is incorrect, as the hours field is 31. The correct result should be * * 31 10 *.

to remedy this, I used the following prompt structure (because this is how most 'cron translators' would read out * * 31 10 *)
```
cwon At every minute at day-of-month 31 in October
* * 31 10 *
```

Sometimes, the model will generate incorrect responses but will return correct responses when re-prompted with the same prompt.

(a consequence of the probabalistic nature of LLMs)

```
cwon At every minute at day-of-month 31 in October
* 31 10 * *
cwon At every minute at day-of-month 31 in October
* * 31 10 *
```
