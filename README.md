A CLI for generating CRON expressions from natrual english phrases in Go. 

It works by making a GET request to [cron prompt](https://cronprompt.com/).

Cron Prompt uses a Large Language Model to generate its Cron expressions. The resulting cron expressions may be innacurate or incomplete as a result. 
It may, however, be capable of handling more complex expressions than more deterministic libraries which use Pushdown automata.
