A CLI for generating CRON expressions from natrual english phrases in Go.

Cron Prompt uses a Large Language Model to generate its Cron expressions. The resulting cron expressions may be innacurate or incomplete as a result. 
It may, however, be capable of handling more complex expressions than more deterministic libraries which use Pushdown automata.
