A CLI for generating CRON expressions from natural english phrases in Go. 

It works by making a GET request to [cron prompt](https://cronprompt.com/).

ðŸš§WarningðŸš§
</h5>

Cron Prompt uses a Large Language Model to generate its Cron expressions. The resulting cron expressions may be innacurate or incomplete as a result. 
It may, however, be capable of handling more complex expressions than more deterministic libraries which use Pushdown automata. If a result seems slightly off, try to prompt the model with different wording.
